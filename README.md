## üé¨ Demo

You can find a demo [here](https://tpn-labs.github.io/react-cookie-tailor/).

## üì¶  Installation

```shell
npm install react-cookie-tailor
```

or use yarn:

```shell
yarn add react-cookie-tailor
```

## üìö About

Our team was looking for a cookie consent solution that was easy to use and looked good. We initially found
another library, but it was not suitable for our needs.
More precisely, we wanted to comply with the GDPR and CPRA regulations, which require that the user must be able to
decline cookies.

To summarize what these regulations require, you need to:
- provide a compliant cookie policy
- display a cookie consent banner at the user's first visit
- store the proof of consent
- block non-exempt cookies before obtaining the user's consent
- release the cookies only after the user has given their consent

## üî® Using it

You can import the cookie bar like this:

```js
import { CookieTailor } from "react-cookie-tailor";
```

Then you can use the component anywhere in your React app like so:

```jsx
<CookieTailor/>
```

### Translations

You can provide translations for the text using the `labels` property. By default, the library will use the English
translations. The default values can be found in [constants/defaultLabels.ts](https://github.com/TPN-Labs/react-cookie-tailor/blob/main/src/constants/defaultLabels.ts)

You can provide your own translations like so:

```js
import CookieTailor, { TailorLabels } from "react-cookie-tailor";

const labels: TailorLabels = {
  // ...
  main: {
    buttonAllow: "Allow all",
    buttonDefault: "Allow default",
    moreSettings: "More settings",
    title: "This website uses cookies"
  }
  // ...
};

<CookieTailor labels={labels}/>
```

### Customizing the colors

You can customize the colors by using the `colors` property. By default, the library will use the following colors:

```js
import CookieTailor, { TailorColors } from "react-cookie-tailor";

const colors: TailorColors = {
  primary: "#2B567D",
  background: "#F5F1F1",
  white: "#FFFFFF",
  black: "#000000",
}

<CookieTailor colors={colors}/>
```

### Providing your cookies details

You can provide your cookies details by using the `cookies` property. By default, the library will use the following
cookies:


### Cookie categories

By default, the library will use the following cookie categories:
- `MANDATORY` for cookies that are necessary for the website to function
- `MARKETING` for marketing cookies
- `PREFRENCES` for cookies that store user preferences
- `STATISTICS` for cookies that analyzes user statistics
- `UNCLASSIFIED` for cookies that do not fall into any of the above categories

You can enable/disable the categories by using the `categories` property. By default, all categories are enabled.

```js
const categories = [
  CookieCategory.MARKETING,
  CookieCategory.PREFRENCES,
  CookieCategory.STATISTICS,
  CookieCategory.UNCLASSIFIED,
];

<CookieTailor categories={categories}/>
```

### Getting the cookies value in your code

react-cookie-tailor exports a function called `getCookieConsentValue(cookieName: string)`. You can use it in your own code like so:

```js
import CookieTailor, { Cookies, getCookieConsentValue } from "react-cookie-tailor";

console.log(getCookieConsentValue("your_custom_cookie_name"));
```

### Reset the cookies value in your code

react-cookie-tailor exports a function called `resetCookieConsentValue`. You can use it in order to remove cookie in client-site:

```js
import CookieTailor, { Cookies, resetCookieConsentValue } from "react-cookie-tailor";

console.log(resetCookieConsentValue());
```

## üêû Debugging it

Because the cookie consent bar will be hidden once accepted, you will have to set the prop `debug={true}` to evaluate styling changes:

```js
<CookieConsent debug={true}></CookieConsent>
```

## ‚ùîQuestions

### Why are there two cookies? One of which named "Legacy"

The short story is that some browsers don't support the SameSite=None attribute.
The modern browsers force you to have SameSite set to something other than none.

So react-cookie-tailor fixes this like so:

- set the fallback cookie (e.g -legacy) first, this will always succeed (on all browsers)
- set the correct cookie second (this will work on modern browsers, fail on older ones)

When checking the cookie it'll do it in reverse. If the regular cookie exists, it'll use that. If no regular cookie exists it'll check whether the legacy cookie exists. If both are non-existent no consent was given.

The long story can be found here: [#PR 68](https://github.com/Mastermindzh/react-cookie-consent/pull/68)

- Update the ChangeLog (or include what you did in the PR and I'll add it, up to you)
- No need to build or update the package.json. I will do both on release.
- Please don't change code convention / style
